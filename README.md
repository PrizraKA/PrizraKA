# 👀 About me 👀

My name is Oleksandr and I beginner C++ and C# developer. I like games and I like to delve into the technical part. My goal is to learn at a high level C++, Enforce Script and C# languages. With C++ and C# I want to create something in Unity or Unreal Engine, but Enforce Script will be useful for me at creating everything what connect with DayZ Development. I love it and I want to create my future by using the above experience and knowledge
